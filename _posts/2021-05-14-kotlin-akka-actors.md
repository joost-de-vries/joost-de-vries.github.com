The Kotlin coroutines world and the Akka actors world are largely disjunct. Having worked with both I thought combining them could work out really nicely. [Here](https://gist.github.com/joost-de-vries/479bbd285c4de23cb5bade21d83e2e22)'s my write up. And [here](https://github.com/joost-de-vries/akka-kotlin) you can find the code. Personally I really like the result.
