### Summary

This here is an abbreviated cv. I'm happy to tell you more. For a cv that includes detailed project experience please contact me at firstname@thisdomain.it.  

_Challenging_: The last few years I’ve developed data intensive systems in the logistical
domain. A common theme was that they were challenging to get right, and that an
events first approach and functional programming were key to make it work. So that
entailed things like event sourcing, CQRS and micro services.  

_You build it you run it_: I currently work bol.com where SRE really matters. I have devops experience with AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform,
Prometheus, Grafana, Heroku.  

_Domain driven_: I bring a lot of insight and experience in how to translate user stories into
manageable software. Thinking in the right way about the domain model and business
process leads to clearer, more successful systems. My study in IT Architecture at Radboud University helps me think clearly about the business side of systems.  

_Smarter together_: In a team I like to collaborate in a way that we’re smarter together and more effective
than each individually. That’s the approach I bring to technical decisions and whiteboard sessions.  

I started out as a Java developer. My curiosity about what makes systems valuable made me do an MA in IT Architecture at Radboud University. After working as an IT Architect for some years in 2014 I became curious about Scala as a more more modern programming language than Java. It's then that I switched back to developing. First in Scala, using functional programming. Later in Kotlin.  


In the last year I gave some talks and advanced Kotlin workshops on Kotlin coroutines and Spring.

#### Experience overview

_February 2020 until now_ I've been working at bol.com on a key customer facing service. Amongst other things: using coroutines and functional programming I made sure that response times remained really low for the customer. I cleaned up and made sure we got to grips with some very hairy existing logic. And I joined some teams to help them deliver and added missing seniority.    

_December 2016 - previous_ I worked at Port of Rotterdam on various projects. A common theme was that events, functional programming in Scala and Kotlin and stream processing where required to make it work. I also spearheaded running on public cloud.  

_November 2015 - previous_ I developed a payment platform. The challenge here was to accelerate a team of maintenance- / operations- people, help them develop in Scala and be productive with functional programming. 

Before that I have 15 years of experience in IT Architecture and Java development.
